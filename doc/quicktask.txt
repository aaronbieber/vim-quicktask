===============================================================================
1. Introduction					*quicktask-introduction*

Quicktask is inspired in no small part by Eric Talevich's "todolist" syntax
highlighting scheme. Though some of the concepts and syntax patterns are
borrowed from that work, Quicktask is a filetype plugin that provides
unique functionality for working with simple lists of tasks that aren't
found anywhere else in Vim.

Quicktask is not org-mode, nor is it a fully-featured personal information
manager. You will get the most out of Quicktask if your work is broken into
distinct assignments that have relatively simple definitions.

===============================================================================
2. Getting Started				*quicktask-getting-started*

The first thing you will want to do is create a new Quicktask file. Open a
fresh Vim instance and call the command QTInit (you would type :QTInit<CR>).
If you run this command in a Vim instance with a file open in the current
buffer, a new buffer will be split and the Quicktask file will be created
there.

You will be greeted with a very barebones task list with two sections,
"current tasks" and "completed tasks," as well as a single "starter" task.

The layout of a Quicktask file is straightforward:

Sections or Projects					*quicktask-sections*
		End in a colon and are expected to contain tasks. Example: >
			CURRENT TASKS:
<
Tasks							*quicktask-tasks*
		Begin with a hyphen followed by a space, and may have "notes"
		or other tasks nested beneath them. Example: >
			CURRENT TASKS:
			  - A task
			    * A note
			    - A second task
<
Notes							*quicktask-notes*
		Begin with an asterisk and usually appear within tasks, though
		they are not required to.  See the example above,
		|quicktask-tasks|.

The hierarchy of information is expressed through indentation and the
indentation has semantic meaning to Quicktask. For example, you can move tasks
up and down among their peers, expand and collapse tasks to hide or reveal all
of their sub-tasks, and so on.

===============================================================================
3. Keyboard Shortcuts				*quicktask-keyboard-shortcuts*

Nearly all of Quicktask's functionality is exposed through keyboard shortcuts
(or "mappings" in Vim parlance). All Quicktask mappings begin with <Leader>t
which is short for "task."

<Leader>to	Insert a new task below the current task (similar to how
		typing "o" in Normal mode inserts on the next line).

<Leader>tO	Insert a new task above the current task (similar to how
		typing "O" in Normal mode inserts on the previous line).

<Leader>tc	Insert a new child task (mnemonic: "task child") at the end of
		the current task.

<Leader>tn	Insert a new note to the current task.

<Leader>tS	Insert a new snip to the current task. The snip note is added
		to the current task and the file is opened for editing. For
		more information on snips, see |quicktask-using-snips|.

<Leader>ts	Add start or end time stamps to the current task (mnemonic:
		"timestamp", "task start", or "time start"). A new note will
		be added to the current task with today's date and a timestamp
		reading "Start." If there is already a note with a start time,
		an end time will be added to it. If there is already a
		complete start and end item, a new one will be added. By
		pressing <Leader>ts repeatedly, you can log the start and stop
		progress of a task.

<Leader>tu	Move the current task up (mnemonic: "task up"). Tasks can only
		be moved up and down among sibling tasks, so they will not
		move between sections (projects).

<Leader>td	Move the current task down (mnemonic: "task down"). Tasks can
		only be moved up and down among sibling tasks, so they will
		not move between sections (projects).

<Leader>tD	Mark a task as "done." This adds a new "note" line at the end
		of the task with the "DONE" keyword and a timestamp. It is
		important to keep in mind that the "DONE" keyword has meaning
		to Quicktask.

<Leader>ta	Show (unfold) active tasks only. This has the effect of
		closing all of the folds in your task list and only expanding
		the ones that do not have a "DONE" keyword in them (and their
		parents). If an incomplete task has completed child tasks,
		only the completed child tasks will be folded. The goal is to
		instantly present a filtered view of active items that need
		attention.

<Leader>ty	Show (unfold) tasks containing today's date. This mapping only
		works when you have used the Quicktask date stamp format for
		the date, as it is a pattern-based match. This would unfold
		items that were added OR completed today.

<Leader>tv	Visually select the current task. This allows you to very
		quickly use Vim's own yank/delete/put commands to move tasks
		around to other sections or copy them to the system clipboard,
		etc.

<Leader>tfi	Find incomplete timestamps (mnemonic: "task find incomplete").
		This mapping actually performs a search for progress lines
		(inserted with <Leader>ts) that have a start time but no end
		time (presumed to be "incomplete"), which may not result in a
		visible change to the buffer, though it WILL force search
		highlighting to be turned on (see |hlsearch|). You can then
		use "n" and "N" to navigate among the found lines.

===============================================================================
4. Abbreviations				*quicktask-abbreviations*

Abbreviations in Vim are used to replace a string with another while entering
text. Quicktask uses Insert-mode abbreviations to provide an easy way to add
datestamps and timestamps to your task lists. The following abbreviations are
available (for information on how to use abbreviations, see |abbreviations| in
the Vim manual). All dates are inserted in the Quicktask standard datestamp
format, e.g.: >
	[Wed 2012-01-18]
<
All abbreviations begin with the at ("@") symbol, which is remembered easily
through the mnemonic of entering a stamp "at" a particular time.

@today		Inserts today's date.
@tomorrow	Inserts tomorrow's date.
@yesterday	Inserts yesterday's date.
@nextweek	Inserts the date exactly seven days from today.
@now		Inserts the current time, e.g. >
			[13:45]
<
===============================================================================
5. Using Snips					*quicktask-using-snips*

Snips are a way for you to attach freeform information to task entries.
Fundamentally snips are text files, but there is no limitation to what
formats the files can be saved in.

Snips are attached to tasks with a special snip note that looks like: >
	* [$: 1234121212-task-name]
<
The first part of the name is a timestamp to ensure that the name is unique
and the second part is taken from the text of the current task so that the
file names hopefully have some contextual meaning outside of the Quicktask
file itself.

To start using snips, you must first configure the path to where you want your
snips to be saved. Do this by configuring g:quicktask_snip_path in your
.vimrc. The path must be absolute! For example, it might look like one of
these: >
	let g:quicktask_snip_path = '~/snips'
	let g:quicktask_snip_path = 'c:\snips'
<
When you open or begin a new Quicktask file, Quicktask will check to see if
the directory exists and if it doesn't, it will ask you if you would like it
to be created.

To add a new snip to a task, simply press <Leader>tS (with a capital "S"). The
snip note is added to the current task and the file is opened for editing.
There are a variety of options available for how that process is handled; see
|quicktask-options| below.

===============================================================================
6. Options					*quicktask-options*

g:quicktask_autosave				*g:quicktask_autosave*
		If set to true (a non-zero number, such as 1), Quicktask will
		attempt to save the current list file when the window loses
		focus or you switch buffers.  This only works in Vim editors
		that respond to the BufLeave or FocusLost events (to my
		knowledge, FocusLost is supported by the graphical variants of
		Vim and BufLeave is supported by all Vims). >
			let g:quicktask_autosave = 1
<
		If the current list file is not saved somewhere, the autosave
		will silently fail! Keep that in mind.

g:quicktask_snip_path				*g:quicktask_snip_path*
		You must configure this option in order to use snips (see
		|quicktask-using-snips|). The option must be set to an
		absolute path on disk where you would like your snip files to
		be saved. For the moment, all snips from all Quicktask lists
		are stored in the same location.

g:quicktask_snip_win_maximize			*g:quicktask_snip_win_maximize*
		If set to 1, the snip window will be opened at full size. The
		default is 0.

g:quicktask_snip_win_height			*g:quicktask_snip_win_height*
		If set to any numeric value, the snip window will open with
		the number of lines or columns given. Note that if
		|g:quicktask_snip_win_maximize| is set, this option will have
		no effect.

g:quicktask_snip_default_filetype
					    *g:quicktask_snip_default_filetype*
		Set this option to the filetype that snips should be created
		as. If you do not specify a filetype, "text" will be used. The
		default filetype is helpfully written into a modeline at the
		end of new snip files. Feel free to change it; Quicktask won't
		override you.

g:quicktask_snip_win_split_direction	*g:quicktask_snip_win_split_direction*
		This option tells Quicktask which way to split the window when
		you open or create a snip. The default is horizontal and the only
		other valid option is "vertical." If you specify anything else, or
		leave it blank, the window will split horizontally.

===============================================================================
7. Organizing Tasks				*quicktask-organizing-tasks*

The philosophy of Quicktask is to provide a simple and versatile feature set
that each user can apply in their own way. Although some of the formatting and
keywords cannot be changed, there are innumerble ways in which to build and
manage a list of tasks. This section briefly covers some of the core concepts
that I have found useful and that I hope you do, too.

I like to keep a section of "current tasks" representing pending work. With
Quicktask, it's easy to add a new task to the list with <Leader>to and begin
working on it with <Leader>ts. When I have completed my work, or get pulled
into another task, I can press <Leader>ts to stop progress.

As I complete tasks, I just press <Leader>tD to mark them as "DONE" and move
on to the next assignment. At the end of the day or week, I press <Leader>ta
to collapse all of the completed tasks and move them into "completed tasks."
Because I perform a lot of smaller tasks, I have created a "completed tasks"
section for each year, e.g. "COMPLETED TASKS (2011):", just to keep things
more organized.

There is no reason not to create any sections or project groupings you can
imagine, including nested sections.

===============================================================================
8. Advanced Topics				*quicktask-advanced-topics*

8.1 Setting the Filetype			*quicktask-adv-filetype*

Quicktask is a filetype plugin (ftplugin), meaning that it is reliant on the
filetype of the current file in order to operate. The Quicktask filetype is
simply "quicktask" and, when set, Vim will load the Quicktask code and make
its commands available to you.

When you create a new Quicktask list with QTInit, a "modeline" is placed at
the end of the file. The modeline will cause Vim to treat the file as a
Quicktask-type file no matter what you name it (for information on modelines,
read |modeline|). If modelines are disabled in your configuration, you may
want to use another method to conveniently re-set the filetype of your
Quicktask files. One common way to achieve that is with a file extension
autocommand (see |autocommand|).

For example, to make all files named *.quicktask open as Quicktask files, add
this line to your .vimrc: >
	autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.quicktask setf quicktask
>
This tells Vim that when opening a new file or reading in a new buffer, if the
filename matches *.quicktask, set the filetype to quicktask (see |setf|).

===============================================================================
9. Known Issues					*quicktask-known-issues*

Quicktask is a labor of love and a side project. As such, there are some
problems, and I know about most of them. So far, the issues haven't been so
great as to stop me from using Quicktask long enough to fix them, but...

If you want to take a stab at it, by all means, send me a pull request on
Github (http://github.com/aaronbieber/quicktask.git) or get in touch with me
