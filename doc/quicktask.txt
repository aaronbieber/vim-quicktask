===============================================================================
1. Introduction					*quicktask-introduction*

Quicktask is inspired in no small part by Eric Talevich's "todolist" syntax 
highlighting scheme. Though some of the concepts and syntax patterns are 
borrowed from that work, Quicktask is a filetype plugin that provides 
unique functionality for working with simple lists of tasks that aren't 
found anywhere else in Vim.

Quicktask is not org-mode, nor is it a fully-featured personal information 
manager. You will get the most out of Quicktask if your work is broken into 
distinct assignments that have relatively simple definitions.

===============================================================================
2. Getting Started				*quicktask-getting-started*

The first thing you will want to do is create a new Quicktask file. Open a 
fresh Vim instance and call the command QTInit (you would type :QTInit<CR>).  
If you run this command in a Vim instance with a file open in the current 
buffer, a new buffer will be split and the Quicktask file will be created 
there.

You will be greeted with a very barebones task list with two sections, 
"current tasks" and "completed tasks," as well as a single "starter" task.

The layout of a Quicktask file is straightforward:

Sections or Projects					*quicktask-sections*
		End in a colon and are expected to contain tasks. Example: >
			CURRENT TASKS:
<
Tasks							*quicktask-tasks*
		Begin with a hyphen followed by a space, and may have "notes" 
		or other tasks nested beneath them. Example: >
			CURRENT TASKS:
			  - A task
			    * A note
			    - A second task
<
Notes							*quicktask-notes*
		Begin with an asterisk and usually appear within tasks, though 
		they are not required to.  See the example above, 
		|quicktask-tasks|.

The hierarchy of information is expressed through indentation and the 
indentation has semantic meaning to Quicktask. For example, you can move tasks 
up and down among their peers, expand and collapse tasks to hide or reveal all 
of their sub-tasks, and so on.

===============================================================================
3. Keyboard Shortcuts				*quicktask-keyboard-shortcuts*

Nearly all of Quicktask's functionality is exposed through keyboard shortcuts 
(or "mappings" in Vim parlance). All Quicktask mappings begin with <Leader>t 
which is short for "task."

<Leader>to	Insert a new task below the current task (similar to how
		typing "o" in Normal mode inserts on the next line). If your 
		cursor is not somewhere within an existing task, this mapping 
		will probably not work (see |quicktask-known-issues|).

<Leader>tO	Insert a new task above the current task (similar to how
		typing "O" in Normal mode inserts on the previous line). If 
		your cursor is not somewhere within an existing task, this 
		mapping will probably not work (see |quicktask-known-issues|).

<Leader>ts	Add start or end time stamps to the current task (mnemonic:
		"timestamp", "task start", or "time start"). A new note will 
		be added to the current task with today's date and a timestamp 
		reading "Start." If there is already a note with a start time, 
		an end time will be added to it. If there is already a 
		complete start and end item, a new one will be added. By 
		pressing <Leader>ts repeatedly, you can log the start and stop 
		progress of a task.

<Leader>tu	Move the current task up (mnemonic: "task up"). Tasks can only
		be moved up and down among sibling tasks, so they will not 
		move between sections (projects).

<Leader>td	Move the current task down (mnemonic: "task down"). Tasks can
		only be moved up and down among sibling tasks, so they will 
		not move between sections (projects).

<Leader>tD	Mark a task as "done." This adds a new "note" line at the end
		of the task with the "DONE" keyword and a timestamp. It is 
		important to keep in mind that the "DONE" keyword has meaning 
		to Quicktask.

<Leader>ta	Show (unfold) active tasks only. This has the effect of 
		closing all of the folds in your task list and only expanding
		the ones that do not have a "DONE" keyword in them (and their 
		parents). If an incomplete task has completed child tasks, 
		only the completed child tasks will be folded. The goal is to 
		instantly present a filtered view of active items that need 
		attention.

<Leader>ty	Show (unfold) tasks containing today's date. This mapping only 
		works when you have used the Quicktask date stamp format for 
		the date, as it is a pattern-based match. This would unfold 
		items that were added OR completed today.

<Leader>tfi	Find incomplete timestamps (mnemonic: "task find incomplete").
		This mapping actually performs a search for progress lines 
		(inserted with <Leader>ts) that have a start time but no end 
		time (presumed to be "incomplete"), which may not result in a 
		visible change to the buffer, though it WILL force search 
		highlighting to be turned on (see |hlsearch|). You can then 
		use "n" and "N" to navigate among the found lines.

===============================================================================
4. Abbreviations				*quicktask-abbreviations*

Abbreviations in Vim are used to replace a string with another while entering 
text. Quicktask uses Insert-mode abbreviations to provide an easy way to add 
datestamps and timestamps to your task lists. The following abbreviations are 
available (for information on how to use abbreviations, see |abbreviations| in 
the Vim manual). All dates are inserted in the Quicktask standard datestamp 
format, e.g.: >
	[Wed 2012-01-18]
<
All abbreviations begin with the at ("@") symbol, which is remembered easily 
through the mnemonic of entering a stamp "at" a particular time.

@today		Inserts today's date.
@tomorrow	Inserts tomorrow's date.
@yesterday	Inserts yesterday's date.
@nextweek	Inserts the date exactly seven days from today.
@now		Inserts the current time, e.g. >
			[13:45]
<
===============================================================================
5. Organizing Tasks				*quicktask-organizing-tasks*

The philosophy of Quicktask is to provide a simple and versatile feature set 
that each user can apply in their own way. Although some of the formatting and 
keywords cannot be changed, there are innumerble ways in which to build and 
manage a list of tasks. This section briefly covers some of the core concepts 
that I have found useful and that I hope you do, too.

I like to keep a section of "current tasks" representing pending work. With 
Quicktask, it's easy to add a new task to the list with <Leader>to and begin 
working on it with <Leader>ts. When I have completed my work, or get pulled 
into another task, I can press <Leader>ts to stop progress.

As I complete tasks, I just press <Leader>tD to mark them as "DONE" and move 
on to the next assignment. At the end of the day or week, I press <Leader>ta 
to collapse all of the completed tasks and move them into "completed tasks." 
Because I perform a lot of smaller tasks, I have created a "completed tasks" 
section for each year, e.g. "COMPLETED TASKS (2011):", just to keep things 
more organized.

There is no reason not to create any sections or project groupings you can 
imagine, including nested sections.

6. Known Issues					*quicktask-known-issues*

Quicktask is a labor of love and a side project. As such, there are some 
problems, and I know about most of them. This is a short list of the issues I 
know exist, but that haven't stopped me from using Quicktask for long enough 
to actually fix them, which generally means that I think they're minor.

If you want to take a stab at it, by all means, send me a pull request on 
Github (http://github.com/aaronbieber/quicktask.git) or get in touch with me 
directly via e-mail at aaron 'at' aaronbieber.com.

1. Inserting new tasks only works if your cursor is located within a task.

	Because Quicktask uses some regex magic to figure out what the indent 
	level is and where to insert new task lines, it is lost without a 
	"reference task," which in normal use is the task the cursor is 
	located within (either on the task line itself or on any note line 
	beneath it).

	It would be nice if it could insert a task before or after any 
	non-task and non-note line and indent and fold everything as any 
	average user would expect.

2. I was sure there were more. Stay tuned... Or submit an issue on Github.
